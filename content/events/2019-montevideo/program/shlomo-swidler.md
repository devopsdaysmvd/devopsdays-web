During the talk I will ask a handful of audience members (volunteers) play a video game together (on their mobile phones), as a demonstration. The game will be very brief, about five minutes, and the audience will observe how the players interact with each other. I will use that as a demonstration of team performance, and then I will speak about how to improve team performance using DevOps.
